# Contribute
This project is open source and meant to be community driven. Any kind of help is appreciated. Since I'm not a big fan of this whole CONTRIBUTE.md and CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md guideline sha-bang, which nobody reads anyway - this is how you do it right:

**1. Check the project's [issues](https://github.com/voodoods/geoquizr/issues):**
  * If there is already an open discussion concerning your problem or suggestion, feel free to take part of the discussion
  * If there it isn't, feel free to open a new one
  * Please condiser using issue template to make it easier for contributors to understand your request

**2. Make sure you're code follows common guide lines and practices:**
  * Test your code: Write unit and e2e tests, test it inside your browser using extreme use cases, make sure you catch possible errors that my break the application
  * Use proper tooling like i.e. code linters, intellisense, editor configuration, etc.
  * Name your methods as what they do and your variables as what they are
  * Avoid writing long unnecessary comments: If you need to explain your code to make others understand what it does, you need to do better

**3. When creating pull quests:** 
  * Summarize what you did and why you did it
  * Reference releated issues
  * If you don't understand change requests, please ask questions and communicate with the reviewer
  * Remember that [you are not your code](https://hackernoon.com/you-are-not-the-code-you-write-e54f02876ca3)

**4. Be respectful when communicating with others:**
  * Try to read and understand other people's posts
  * Before you make contributions, think about how others can benefit from it and how it contributes to the topic at hand
  * Don't hate or hassle
  * In other words: Don't be a d***
